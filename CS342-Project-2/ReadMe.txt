**********************OTHER STUFF/MORE DETAIL***********************

My project consists of multiple interconected classes so it is a bit difficult to explain what is going on internaly, but generally speaking it is alligned with Professr Bell's diagrams (avalible on the class website). Since the Exam does not provide a getQuestion method the points the tester got for each question are printed in the exam class instead of the exam tester. To the best of my knowledge everything should work as described in the project prompt.
