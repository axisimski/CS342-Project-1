**********************OTHER STUFF/MORE DETAIL***********************

My project consists of multiple interconected classes so it is a bit difficult to explain what is going on internaly, but generally speaking it is alligned with Professr Bell's diagrams (avalible on the class website). Since the Exam does not provide a getQuestion method the points the tester got for each question are printed manually in the exam tester class. Other than that everything should work as described in the project prompt.
